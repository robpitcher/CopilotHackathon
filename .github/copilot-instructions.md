# Copilot Instructions (Repository)
- Respect existing language/framework choices across the repo.
- Prefer small, readable functions; clear names; minimal dependencies.
- Add brief docstrings/comments for new code.
- Write tests using existing tooling in each folder when present.
- Avoid secrets and hardcoded credentials; prefer environment variables.
- When unsure, follow conventions shown in nearby files and READMEs.
