# Create My Onboarding Plan

I'm a new team member working with this repository's ${input:language:Language or persona} exercise files and I need help getting started.

My background: ${input:background:Briefly describe your experience level - new to tech, experienced developer new to this stack, etc.}

Please create a personalized onboarding plan to help me ramp up effectively. The plan should include:

1. A phased approach to learning the codebase and tools over the first 30, 60, and 90 days.
2. Suggested first tasks or issues I can work on to get familiar with the project.
3. Key resources or documentation I should review.
4. Any recommended team members I should connect with for guidance.
